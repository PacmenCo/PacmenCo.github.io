        <h2>What are Talents?</h2>
        <p>
          Talents are passive bonuses that can be purchased using <strong><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="talent-points">Talent Points</span></strong>. The talent system is
          organized
          as a skill tree with interconnected nodes, each providing various stat bonuses to improve your character's
          power in combat, survivability, and utility.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Free respec - reset your talents at any time with no cost</li>
          <li>Save and load talent builds for easy switching</li>
          <li>Three talent trees: Offensive, Defensive, and Utility</li>
          <li>Prerequisites system - unlock advanced talents by investing in earlier ones</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section" id="earning-talent-points">
        <h2>Earning Talent Points</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="talent-points">Talent Points</span></strong> are earned primarily by gaining <strong><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="rank">ranks</span></strong>. Each time you rank up, you receive 1 talent point.
        </p>

        <h3>Talent Point Formula</h3>
        <div class="formula-box">
          Available Talent Points = Rank + Bought Points + Ascension Bonuses + Purchase Bonus - Spent Points
        </div>

        <h3>Talent Point Sources</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Ranks:</strong> 1 talent point per rank (primary source)</li>
          <li><strong>Purchased Points:</strong> Can be bought separately from the shop</li>
          <li><strong>Ascension Perk - "MoreSkill":</strong> +3 points per level (max 3 levels = +9 total)</li>
          <li>+5 points for purchasing the talent tree unlock</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
          <strong>One-Time Bonus:</strong> Purchasing the talent tree unlock grants a permanent bonus of 5 extra talent
          points.
        </div>

        <h3>How to Gain Ranks</h3>
        <p>
          Ranks are earned by accumulating Rank XP from defeating enemies.
        </p>

        <div class="formula-box">
          Base Rank XP = 0.7 × randomFactor × (enemyLevel^1.1) + 3<br>
          Final Rank XP = Base × Modifiers
        </div>

        <p>
          <strong>Rank XP Modifiers include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Difficulty modifier (Easy/Normal/Hard/Hardcore)</li>
          <li>Pet XP bonuses</li>
          <li>Talent XP bonuses (Learner talents: +2% per level)</li>
          <li>XP buffs from consumables</li>
          <li>Ascension modifiers (+3% per Normal, +4% per Hard, +5% per Hardcore)</li>
          <li>Ascension Perk - "BattleBrainy" (+10% per level, max 50%)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>XP Required Per Rank</h3>
        <div class="formula-box">
          XP Needed = 0.9801 × (currentRank^3) + 200 × currentRank - 101
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section" id="talent-point-costs">
        <h2>Talent Point Costs</h2>
        <p>
          Each talent has an increasing cost per level. The cost rises with each talent level you invest.
        </p>

        <h3>Cost Formula</h3>
        <div class="formula-box">
          Cost per Level = Base Cost + Current Talent Level
        </div>

        <h3>Cost Examples</h3>
        <p>For a talent with base cost 1:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Level 1: costs 1 SP (total: 1)</li>
          <li>Level 2: costs 2 SP (total: 3)</li>
          <li>Level 3: costs 3 SP (total: 6)</li>
          <li>Level 4: costs 4 SP (total: 10)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Talents have different base costs (1, 2, or 3 SP) and different maximum levels (1-4 levels depending on the
          talent).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section" id="talent-trees">
        <h2>Talent Trees</h2>
        <p>
          Talents are organized into three trees, each focusing on a different aspect of character power.
        </p>

        <h3>Offensive Tree</h3>

          <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> +1 accuracy per level (max 3)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Defensive Tree</h3>
        <p>

          <li><strong>Health:</strong> +20 flat HP per level (max 3)</li>

          <li><strong>Cure Poison:</strong> 35% chance to cure poison when healing per level (max 2)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="content-section" id="talent-effectiveness">
        <h2>Talent Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>
          All talent effects can be amplified through <strong><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="ascension-perks">Ascension Perks</span></strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="formula-box">
          Actual Effect = Base Effect × (1 + SkillQuality Ascension Perk)
        </div>

        <p>
          The <span class="stat-highlight">SkillQuality</span> Ascension Perk provides +3% effectiveness per level
          (max 5 levels = +15% improvement to all talents).
        </p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          A Strength talent normally gives +1.5% damage. With SkillQuality at level 5:
        </p>
        <div class="formula-box">
          Actual Damage = 1.5% × (1 + 0.15) = 1.5% × 1.15 = 1.725% damage per level

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What are talents in Idle Adventure?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Talents are passive bonuses that customize your character's strengths and playstyle. They're
            organized
            into specialized trees (Offensive, Defensive, Utility) and provide bonuses like increased damage,
            survivability, or
            resource efficiency. Talent points are earned by ranking up and can be allocated to any available talent.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I earn talent points?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Talent points are earned automatically when you rank up your character. Each rank grants 1 talent point. You
            can
            also earn bonus points from the Ascension Perk "MoreSkill" (+3 per level, max +9), purchasing talent points
            from
            the shop, and unlocking the talent tree (+5 one-time bonus).
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much do talents cost?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Talent costs increase with each level invested. The formula is: Cost per Level = Base Cost + Current Talent
            Level.
            For example, a talent with base cost 1 costs 1 point for level 1, 2 points for level 2, 3 points for level
            3, and
            so on. This encourages balanced builds across multiple talents.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I reset my talents?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes! You can respec your talents at any time with no cost or cooldown. All spent talent points are refunded
            instantly, allowing you to experiment with different builds freely. You can also save and load talent builds
            for
            easy switching between configurations.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What are the different talent trees?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            There are three talent trees: Offensive (damage, critical hits, offensive stats), Defensive (HP, armor,
            survivability), and Utility (resource generation, efficiency, support bonuses). You can invest in multiple
            trees
            to create balanced or specialized builds based on your playstyle.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Should I specialize in one tree or spread points across multiple?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            This depends on your playstyle and progression stage. Specializing in one tree maximizes effectiveness in
            that
            area but may leave weaknesses. Spreading points creates balanced builds with fewer weak points. Early game
            often
            benefits from balanced allocation, while late game allows for more specialization due to abundant talent
            points.
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How does talent effectiveness work?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Talent effectiveness determines how much each talent point invested improves your stats. The SkillQuality
            ascension
            skill provides +3% effectiveness per level (max 5 levels = +15%). This means a talent giving +1.5% damage
            becomes
            +1.725% damage with max SkillQuality, making all talents more efficient.

          <summary>Can I save multiple talent builds?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes! You can save your favorite talent configurations locally with custom names and load them instantly.
            This is
            perfect for switching between PvE, PvP, or boss-specific builds. If a saved build requires more talent
            points
            than you currently have, it will automatically reset when you try to load it.
