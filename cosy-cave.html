      <h2>Scoring System</h2>
      <p>
        Your score determines rewards and is based on kills, remaining time, and difficulty multiplier.
      </p>

      <p class="formula-box">
        Score = (kills + 1)^1.4 × ((timer + 30) / 3) × difficulty
      </p>

      <h3>Score Components</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Kills:</strong> Number of bosses defeated (exponential scaling with 1.4 power)</li>
        <li><strong>Time Bonus:</strong> Extra 30 seconds added to remaining timer, divided by 3</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy (1.0x), Normal (1.4x), Hard (2.2x)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The exponential kills scaling means each additional boss defeated provides
        increasingly more score.

      <h2>Strategy Guide</h2>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Choose Difficulty Wisely:</strong> Match difficulty to your gear and level to optimize your rewards
          per key</li>
        <li><strong>Balance your Build:</strong> The Cosy Cave favors builds that can do both high damage and
          survivability</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optimize score</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Set hardest difficulty where you are able to defeat all bosses</li>
        <li><strong>Buff Before Entry:</strong> Apply all elixirs and buffs before entering (fish for the perfect
          experimental buff)</li>
        <li><strong>Player Level:</strong> Be level 301 (At level 301 you have the best hit chance and a 5% damage
          bonus)</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Speed:</strong> Kill bosses as fast as possible to maximize score</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cooldowns Aggressively:</strong> All abilities should be used on cooldown</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optimization</h3>
      <p class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> With free keys available regularly, you can experiment with different
        difficulties and builds to find your optimal strategy.

    <section class="content-section" id="cave-keys">
      <h2>Cave Key Crafting</h2>
      <p>
        Cave Keys are crafted using Pixels and Voxels. The cost increases with each key crafted but also decays over
        time.
      </p>

      <h3>Penalty System</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Penalty per purchase:</strong> 130 penalty per key crafted</li>
        <li><strong>Result:</strong> Costs gradually decrease if you stop crafting keys (faster decay at higher
          penalties)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="formula-box">
        Decay per tick: 1 + penalty/115<br>
        Applied every 30 seconds
      </p>

      <h3>Decay Examples</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>At 115 penalty:</strong> Decay = 1 + (115/115) = 2 per tick</li>
        <li><strong>At 230 penalty:</strong> Decay = 1 + (230/115) = 3 per tick</li>
        <li><strong>At 575 penalty:</strong> Decay = 1 + (575/115) = 6 per tick</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Higher penalties decay significantly faster —the more you've crafted
        recently, the faster your penalty decreases.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do I get Cave Keys for The Cosy Cave?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Cave Keys are crafted using Pixels and Voxels. Your first key is free (0-9 penalty range). Each key crafted adds 130 penalty, increasing costs. Penalties decay over time at a rate of 1 + (penalty/115) every 30 seconds. Check the shop regularly for free keys. You can hold up to 3 keys maximum.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What difficulty should I choose for The Cosy Cave?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Choose the hardest difficulty where you can defeat all bosses. Hard difficulty provides a 2.2x score multiplier, Normal gives 1.4x, and Easy gives 1.0x. Match difficulty to your current gear and level - it's better to complete on a lower difficulty than fail partway through a harder one.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is score calculated in The Cosy Cave?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Score formula: (kills + 1)^1.4 × ((timer + 30) / 3) × difficulty. Kills use exponential scaling (1.4 power), meaning each additional boss provides increasingly more score. Remaining time gets +30 bonus seconds added then divided by 3. Difficulty multiplier is Easy (1.0x), Normal (1.4x), or Hard (2.2x).
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What rewards do I get from The Cosy Cave?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Each boss defeated grants significant experience points. Enemies in the cave have increased loot modifiers for better drops. High scores unlock special pets. The sequential boss rush format makes it an excellent XP farming location when you have Cave Keys available.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What level should I be for The Cosy Cave?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Level 301 is optimal. At this level, you have the best hit chance against bosses and gain a 5% damage bonus. However, you can attempt The Cosy Cave at lower levels by choosing an appropriate difficulty. Start with Easy difficulty if under-leveled, then progress to Normal and Hard as your build improves.
