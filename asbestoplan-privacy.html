    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <p>AsbestoPlan ("we", "our", "the app") is a floor plan and asbestos survey tool. We take your privacy seriously. This policy explains what data the app handles and how.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>AsbestoPlan does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. We do not have a backend, analytics service, or tracking of any kind. We do not know who you are or how you use the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All data you create in the app is stored locally on your device only:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Floor plans</strong> — drawings, lines, objects, labels, and measurements</li>
        <li><strong>Sample pins</strong> — numbered pins with status flags, notes, and attached media</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong> — images captured or picked from your gallery, including annotations</li>
        <li><strong>Audio recordings</strong> — voice notes recorded within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Transcriptions</strong> — text generated from audio using on-device speech recognition</li>
        <li><strong>Settings</strong> — your preferences (theme, units, speech model selection)</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription status</strong> — a local cache of whether you have an active subscription</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it (e.g. sending a PDF report via the share sheet).</p>

    <h2>Camera and Photo Library</h2>
    <p>The app requests access to your camera and photo library so you can attach photos to sample pins. Photos are stored locally within the app's private storage. They are not uploaded anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Microphone</h2>
    <p>The app requests microphone access so you can record audio notes attached to sample pins. Recordings are stored locally. Audio transcription is performed entirely on your device using an offline AI model — no audio data is sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Speech Recognition Models</h2>
    <p>The app downloads open-source speech recognition models (Whisper by OpenAI, via the sherpa-onnx library) from HuggingFace when you first enable transcription. This is the only network request the app makes besides in-app purchase verification. The models are stored locally and all transcription runs on your device.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Subscription purchases are handled entirely by Google Play (Android) or the App Store (iOS). We do not process or store any payment information. Purchase verification is handled by the respective platform's billing system.</p>

    <h2>Internet Access</h2>
    <p>The app uses internet access for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Downloading speech recognition models (one-time, on demand)</li>
        <li>In-app purchase verification via Google Play or the App Store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other network requests are made. The app works fully offline after the initial model download.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>AsbestoPlan is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any data from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this policy, we will post the revised version on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
